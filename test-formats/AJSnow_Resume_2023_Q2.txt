* Collaborated with and mentored fellow engineers on my team to create comprehensive design documents for backend systems,  typically for new feature development, or explore and understand legacy aspects of existing code 
* Enhanced and standardized development environments by various initiatives
   * Updated outdated documentation across various services
   * Added local dev configs to tightened REPL loops
   * Implemented testing frameworks 
   * Standardized deployment methodologies for versioning
